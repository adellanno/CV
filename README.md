Anthony Dell'Anno
=================
Junior web developer with a passion for creating and building new things. Self-taught to code at first, I recently graduated from Makers Academy. I am now seeking full-time employment as a junior developer in a company where continued learning is supported and encouraged.

Skills
------
- Adaptable and a quick learner. I graduated with a degree in Contemporary History in 2011 and now in a relatively short space of time I have taught myself to code using my own resources as well as those provided at Makers Academy.
- Desire to code and keep coding! I built my first "Hello world" website in HTML and CSS one year ago which set me on this new career path. The last year of coding has been a hugely exciting period for me and I can't wait to continue the journey.
- Well written and great communication skills. If my degree in History has taught me anything, it taught me how to write well and be a great communicator, a skill highly valued in all team projects!
